## NPM Auto-audit

* This handy-dandy little script will run NPM audits on your code repos and output a useful json file with recommendations on what to do.  
* First make sure you have python installed and that it's on your $PATH
* Navigate to the repos directory
* `git clone` any repos you want to audit such that you have a copy of the repo as a subdirectory of "repos"
* remove the "insert-repos-here" file
* From the root directory of this repo, run the auto-run-audit.sh script as sudo and you should be golden!
